= jQAssistant Gradle Example Project

Use this project for prototyping new functionality for the jQAssistant plugin.

This project automatically reflects *every change* done in `src`.

== Usage

The following commands analyze the plugin itself:

----
$ cd example
$ ../gradlew scan analyze server
----

You should be able to go to http://localhost:7474/ and observe that jQAssistant
has applied the concept from the rules directory: the plugin class node now has
additional labels named "Gradle" and "Plugin".
